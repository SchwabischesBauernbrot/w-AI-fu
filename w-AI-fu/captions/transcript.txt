 Do you like the weather? It's getting kind of warm out today, I don't like it. I hope it starts raining again, I just love it when the rain makes all the puddles around me look like a swamp. The most I can hope for is that some thunder storms are around the corner, but I'll be fine as long as it's cold enough for me to wear my snuggies.
