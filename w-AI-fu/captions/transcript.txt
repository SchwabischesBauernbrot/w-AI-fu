 development in terms of processing power. For example, Intel recently released its latest processor known as Kaby Lake. Its predecessor was Skylake, another successful product line developed last year. These processors use 14nm process node, meaning they have smaller dimensions compared to previous generations. Their manufacturing processes allow companies to produce chips faster without sacrificing quality. Furthermore, manufacturers are constantly improving upon existing technologies in order to increase overall speed and reliability. One company that stands above others in producing high performing CPUs is AMD. Recently they announced Ryzen 7 1800X CPU series. With 8 cores and 16 threads, it offers incredible computing
